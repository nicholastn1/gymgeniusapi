# GymGenius

## Description
GymGenius is an Rails API that allows users to create and track daily workouts. Users can log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. Users can also track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, users can track their distance traveled.
